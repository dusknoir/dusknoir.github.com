About Dusknoir
==============

I play a [Shadow priest](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/illidan/dusknoir/) and [rogue](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/illidan/burial/), with (mostly inactive) alts on Kel'Thuzad and Mannoroth. I've been playing since 2007, and since then I've went by Dusknoir and Burial.

I love programming in Ruby and Lua and all of my projects are released into the public domain. You can find a list of my projects (some of which are Warcraft addons) on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/dusknoir). If you need to get in touch, you can [email me directly](mailto:me@dusknoir.net).

This website is built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). Backgrounds are from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com) (inverted _Light Grunge_ and darkened _Broken Noise_) and the fonts are [Broken 15](http://www.dafont.com/broken15.font) and [Droid Sans](http://www.droidfonts.com/info/droid-sans-fonts/). **These works are not my property.** Wowhead icons are [implemented](https://github.com/dusknoir/dusknoir.github.com/blob/source/lib/core_ext/wowlinks.rb) with [wowlinks](https://github.com/dusknoir/wowlinks) --- feel free to borrow.

The layout makes extensive use of HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript, and therefore requires a modern browser. Comments are served dynamically with [Disqus](http://disqus.com); beware that default NoScript and Ghostery settings block Disqus and prevent comments from loading.
