About Dusknoir
==============

I started playing World of Warcraft around July of 2008 as a [Frost mage](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/mannoroth/noisia/). I created my [Shadow priest](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/kelthuzad/dusknoir/) when Wrath of the Lich King was released and, while I still occasionally play my [rogue](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/illidan/burial/) or mage, it's the only character I call my main, and the character I'll be playing for as long as I'm playing the game.

I love programming (with my primary tool being Ruby) and open source software. You can find a list of my projects (some of which are Warcraft addons) on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/dusknoir). If you need to get in touch, you can [email me directly](mailto:me@dusknoir.net).
