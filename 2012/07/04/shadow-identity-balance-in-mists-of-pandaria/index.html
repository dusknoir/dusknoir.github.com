Not long enough to say I remember <a class='wowlinks epic' href='http://wowhead.com/item=18609' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_12.gif)'>Anathema</a>, <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=33076' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_prayerofmendingtga.gif)'>Prayer of Mending</a> without a cooldown or perhaps even the old <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=15407' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_siphonmana.gif)'>Mind Flay</a> animation, but it has been about three years. Late last year, I played my 9,260th arena match. I remember how it went: I faked <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=6552' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_04.gif)'>Pummel</a> and tried casting again. I was stunned. Stunned again. And then <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=6552' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_04.gif)'>Pummel</a> was up. This happens nearly every match as a priest, but it was this time I finally concluded: it's not fun to play a priest anymore.</p><p>I wanted to play one of the classes that feels entirely developed. To me, that category includes mages, warlocks, rogues and death knights. The former three have been strong at any given point in the game's history, and death knights were implemented later, benefitting from more experienced and knowledgeable designers.</p><p>Rogue was one of the classes I considered when I first started playing the game, but I settled on mage and then eventually switched to priest. I got to making <a href="//us.battle.net/wow/en/character/illidan/burial/">my rogue</a> on the 5th on January, and by the 12th I was level 85 with an average item level of 392. It plays very differently than my priest in many ways, but a few more than others.</p><h1 id=toolkit-and-capabilities>Toolkit and Capabilities</h1><p>My rogue has a tool to react to every situation. I can switch targets quickly and easily. I can stop a cast at any given moment with one of three short cooldowns, or three longer ones in an emergency. I can peel for my partner with stuns, incapacitates, snares and disarms. I can put out ridiculous levels of burst damage without a lot of luck and setup. I can react to enemies focusing me with <em>five</em> defensive cooldowns.</p><p>On my priest, I have three crowd control spells: <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=15487' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_priest_silence.gif)'>Silence</a>, <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=64044' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_psychichorrors.gif)'>Psychic Horror</a> and <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=8122' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_psychicscream.gif)'>Psychic Scream</a>. Each is underwhelming in its own way: <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=15487' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_priest_silence.gif)'>Silence</a> lasts two seconds less than <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=2139' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_iceshock.gif)'>Counterspell</a>, but has nearly double the cooldown; <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=64044' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_psychichorrors.gif)'>Psychic Horror</a> has a disproportionately long cooldown for a three-second horrify; and warlocks have their own version of <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=8122' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_psychicscream.gif)'>Psychic Scream</a> <em>in addition to a spammable fear.</em> My sole defensive cooldown is <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=47585' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_dispersion.gif)'>Dispersion</a>, and my two burst damage cooldowns are <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=87153' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_priest_archangel.gif)'>Dark Archangel</a> and <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=34433' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowfiend.gif)'>Shadowfiend</a>. All three are tied to my mana regeneration, so if I strive to use them properly, I'll eventually run out mana.</p><p>Priests don't have nearly enough tools to stop casts, damage and survive. They're the only class without an interrupt, they have long cooldowns on their crowd control spells, and they have few defensive cooldowns. This makes for boring, unengaging and simple gameplay, and requires you play with one of the few classes with &quot;complete&quot; toolkits (like warlocks) to compete.</p><h1 id=the-melee-v-caster-arms-race>The Melee v. Caster Arms Race</h1><p>This problem is one often acknowledged, but never fixed. It stems from adding too many tools of one kind to a single class, and then buffing opposing classes to compete against that one, forgetting others without those tools.</p><p>Take, for example, Frost mages roots. At least one has been added in every expansion. To compensate for this, melee have been given increasing mobility. Most of them can have a satisfactory uptime on Frost mages. But what about other casters who don't have the same tools mages do? It's possible and reasonable for a melee of any variety to have near-100% uptime on non-mage casters.</p><p>The second example is interrupts. Rogues, warriors and death knights have too many ways to stop casts. To let them perform in Cataclysm, mages and warlocks were shifted to instant casts with buffs to <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=30455' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostblast.gif)'>Ice Lance</a> and the creation of <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=86121' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warlock_soulswap.gif)'>Soul Swap</a>. A Frost mage could, at one point, go an entire game using only <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=30455' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostblast.gif)'>Ice Lance</a> for damage and <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=71757' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mage_deepfreeze.gif)'>Deep Freeze</a> into <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=82691' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_ring-of-frost.gif)'>Ring of Frost</a> for crowd control. Warlocks can forgo <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=5782' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_possession.gif)'>Fear</a> entirely, using only <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=5484' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathscream.gif)'>Howl of Terror</a>.</p><p>For other classes, fighting a melee means being trained start to finish, juking an interrupt every ten seconds, and being stunned at all points in between. Mages and warlocks are the only classes that can compete with the amount of interrupts and stuns in the game, and there hasn't been a point where they weren't the top (or only viable) casters. Several interrupts and roots should be removed or nerfed in Mists, shifting all casters back to cast-based gameplay, or every caster should be able to utilize instants in the same way as warlocks and mages.</p><h1 id=loss-of-identity>Loss of Identity</h1><p>If somebody were to ask me to define Shadow, I would say &quot;an interesting mixture of damage and healing&quot;. They heal themselves and their allies while damaging with <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=15286' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unsummonbuilding.gif)'>Vampiric Embrace</a>. They can shield, heal and dispel their friends as necessary. And they deal damage in the same unique way: not exclusively through periodic damage, and not only through burst damage.</p><p>In Cataclysm, close to none of the above is true. <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=15286' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unsummonbuilding.gif)'>Vampiric Embrace</a> is so negligible you can sometimes forget to use it and not notice. <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=527' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_dispelmagic.gif)'>Dispel Magic</a> can no longer be cast on your friends because, while dispel cleave with <a class='wowlinks legendary' href='http://wowhead.com/item=49623' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_113.gif)'>Shadowmourne</a> was okay in Lich King, two dispels is overpowered for Shadow. And, in Cataclysm, we see <em>all but one of our heals removed.</em> There is nothing left to define Shadow.</p><h1 id=a-conclusion>A Conclusion</h1><p>Shadow is a spec that, given patient partners of a specific class, can succeed. One might argue that this means Shadow doesn't need changes, but the problem isn't only balance: Shadow's lack of tools and identity makes it one-dimensional and without a significant skill gap. Shadow should have the same amount of tools as the top casters: warlocks and mages; whether this is done by nerfing other class's (simultaneously fixing <a href="#the-melee-v-caster-arms-race">the melee v. caster arms race</a>) or buffing Shadow's doesn't matter.</p><p>In Mists, the never-used <a href="//www.wowhead.com/spell=92711">Satin set bonus</a> could be changed to reduce the cooldown of <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=15487' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_priest_silence.gif)'>Silence</a> by 20 seconds, bringing it closer (while still inferior) to <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=2139' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_iceshock.gif)'>Counterspell</a>. <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=64044' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_psychichorrors.gif)'>Psychic Horror</a>'s cooldown should be reduced to 45 seconds — <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=6789' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathcoil.gif)'>Death Coil</a> has seen the same treatment in Mists, and also heals for 25% of your maximum health. Our (and other hybrid's) heals should stay, and friendly magic dispel should be returned to the classes that lost it. The mana cost and risks associated with <a class='wowlinks spell' href='http://wowhead.com/spell=32375' style='background-image:url(http://static.wowhead.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_massdispel.gif)'>Mass Dispel</a> make it an unsuitable replacement.</p></div></article><aside id=disqus_thread><noscript><p>Please enable JavaScript to view comments.</p></noscript></aside></section><footer><p id=public-domain><a rel=license href="//unlicense.org">All content on DUSKNOIR.NET is released into the public domain.</a></p><p id=source><a href="https://github.com/dusknoir/dusknoir.github.com/tree/source/">The source code that generates this website is available on GitHub.</a></p></footer><script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js'></script><script>$||document.write("<script src='/javascripts/jquery-1.7.2-434eab21.js'><\/script>");var _gaq=[['_setAccount','UA-33267980-1'],['_trackPageview']],disqus_developer=location.hostname==='localhost'?1:0,disqus_shortname='dusknoir';$(document.createElement('script')).attr({type:'text/javascript',src:'http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js'}).appendTo('head');</script><script src="/javascripts/site-b17779b5.js"></script><script src='//dusknoir.disqus.com/embed.js'></script></body></html>
