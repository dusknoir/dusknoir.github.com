They're also limited to 16 characters, and exclude some non-alphanumeric symbols. And passwords are very easy to crack: computers built for the purpose, with multiple graphics cards, can test between 100,000 and 3 million passwords per second. Still, you have an authenticator, right? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication#Tokens_with_a_display_.28disconnected_tokens.29">Two-factor authentication</a> should make up for any lapses in Blizzard's security.</p><p>It doesn't: <a href="//www.arenajunkies.com/topic/227822-proof-hydrahacked/">Xandyn (allegedly) accessed Hydra's account</a> and disbanded his arena teams. Hydra's password may not have been great, but he did use an authenticator.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel=footnote>1</a></sup> Xandyn accessed his account by exploiting the weakest link in Blizzard's security: humans.</p><h1 id=conning-blizzard>Conning Blizzard</h1><p>He called Blizzard and presented a fake ID, claiming to be Hydra. We can't blame Blizzard for assuming Xandyn was really Hydra. They don't record photos, so any ID with a matching name can be used. That isn't a problem on their end, because recording photos and ID raises several problems with regards to privacy. <a href="//www.joystiq.com/2010/07/09/real-id-nixed-from-blizzard-forums-morhaime-explains/">People don't like their real identities being tied to the game.</a></p><p>The fault is in Blizzard relying on that alone, because of how trivial (albeit illegal) it is to create fake identification. Surely, Xandyn couldn't answer any <a href="//www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/06/mitt_romney_email_hack_which_password_recovery_questions_are_most_secure_.html"><em>secure</em> recovery questions</a> that Hydra may have had in place, and couldn't answer any questions regarding Hydra's billing information.</p><h1 id=what-to-take-from-this>What to Take From This</h1><p>In security, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29">the weakest link is always humans</a>. And not only Blizzard; you couldn't count how many people are more than willing to hand over their information to an in-game password inspector. People need to choose secure passwords; they need to choose secure recovery questions; they need to use an authenticator; and, most importantly, they need Blizzard to respect those things. This could be the catalyst to widespread identity fraud in the PVP community â€” it being illegal didn't stop DDOSing.</p><div class=footnotes><ol><li id="fn:1"><p><a href="//www.arenajunkies.com/topic/227779-hydra-hacked-2-days-before-season-end/page__view__findpost__p__3750781">Hydra hacked 2 days before season end! - Arena Junkies</a><a href="#fnref:1" rel=reference>&#8617;</a></p></li></ol></div></div></article><aside id=disqus_thread><noscript><p>Please enable JavaScript to view comments.</p></noscript></aside></section><footer><p id=public-domain><a rel=license href="//unlicense.org">All content on DUSKNOIR.NET is released into the public domain.</a></p><p id=source><a href="https://github.com/dusknoir/dusknoir.github.com/tree/source/">The source code that generates this website is available on GitHub.</a></p></footer><script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js'></script><script>$||document.write("<script src='/javascripts/jquery-1.7.2-434eab21.js'><\/script>");var _gaq=[['_setAccount','UA-33267980-1'],['_trackPageview']],disqus_developer=location.hostname==='localhost'?1:0,disqus_shortname='dusknoir';$(document.createElement('script')).attr({type:'text/javascript',src:'http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js'}).appendTo('head');</script><script src="/javascripts/site-b17779b5.js"></script><script src='//dusknoir.disqus.com/embed.js'></script></body></html>
